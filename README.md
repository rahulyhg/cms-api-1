# Docker containers
This is a docker boiler palte for all my php project which run on Ubuntu16.04 (LAMP)

1. Run a dev environment in docker
    - Apache2/PHP
    - MySQL
    - Redis (mainly for cache)
2. Create our image by using Dockerfile
3. Combine our image file with pre-made images (MySQL/Redis)
4. Assemble all to gather in (docker-compose.yml)
5. Create a shortcut way to build or run docker
